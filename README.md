# RPS-odin

In this version I plan to make a rock-paper-scissors game based entirely within the dev console. A graphical interface will be created later along the line.

Problem breakdown:

-Create randomnumber
-divide randomnumber created at time so will equal to or less than these 3 values: 1/3 2/3 1.
-assign return values such as:1/3 = rock 2/3 = paper 1 = scissors.
-create prompt to take in user's choice
-match user's choice against computer choice, create a win, lose or tie scenario for each possible user input.

Results:
Used console.log five timess to simulate a loop to produce five rounds of rock, paper, scissors.
